                        FISH TREND ANALYSIS DATA                               



Annual fish monitoring on the Upper Mississippi River System (UMRS)            

was implemented in 1990 under the Long Term Resource Monitoring Program        

(LTRMP).  Some preliminary sampling was conducted during 1989 to test          

sampling methods in Pools 8, 13 and 26; however, these data are best           

viewed as developmental data that are less useful for routine trend            

analysis.                                                                      



From 1990 through 1992, all fish sampling was conducted at subjectively        

chosen permanently fixed sampling sites within each aquatic area.              

Each site consisted of a pair of sampling locations separated by about         

50 meters (occasionally separated by as much as 200 meters).  In the           

original LTRMP fish sampling design, these pairs of sampling locations         

within fixed sites were considered replicates for the site and for the         

aquatic area.                                                                  



A statistical review of the sampling program was planned and conducted         

during 1992, critically examining the original LTRMP fish monitoring           

design and considering design alternatives.  The final report from this        

review (Gutreuter 1993) is available by request from the UMESC.                



A second statistical review of the sampling program was planned and            

conducted during 2001, critically examining whether sampling efficiencies      

could be gained.  The final report from this review                            

(Ickes and Burkhardt 2002) is available by request from the                    

Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center.                                   



As a result of the 1992 statistical review of the LTRMP fish monitoring        

program, major procedural changes were implemented in 1993.                    

The LTRMP Fisheries Component adopted a stratified random sampling design,     

with aquatic areas serving as strata.  Spatially randomized sites, with        

proper independent replication within strata, are currently sampled.           

Subjectively chosen permanently fixed sites have been retained in              

tailwaters (which are too small to permit meaningful replicated random         

sampling) and at a few sites of special interest (having historical            

occurrences of endangered species, associated with                             

habitat restoration projects, etc.).                                           



The 2001 statistical review resulted in minor procedural changes that          

were implemented in 2002.  Specifically, four gears were removed from the      

sampling design (night electrofishing, seining, tandem fyke nets, and          

tandem mini fyke nets).  Thus, beginning in 2002, data associated with         

these four gear types are neither available from nor collected by              

the program.  Please review Ickes and Burkhardt (2002) for details             

regarding this change in procedure.

Use of LTRMP Trend Data for Fish Monitoring                                    



The sampling design for fishes is sufficiently complex that all potential      

users of these data are strongly encouraged to read and understand the Fish    

Monitoring section of the LTRMP Procedures Manual (Gutreuter et al. 1995),     

which describes both historical and current procedures, before undertaking     

any analysis or interpretation of data.  This document is accessible

                                   SUMMARY                                     



LTRMP Fish Sampling Design                                                     



The LTRMP conducts annual monitoring of fishes in six study reaches of the     

Upper Mississippi River System:  Navigation Pools 4, 8, 13 and 26, and an      

unimpounded reach near Cape Girardeau, Missouri, on the Mississippi River; and 

La Grange Pool on the Illinois River.  The LTRMP will continue to expand fish  

monitoring beyond these six study reaches, and welcomes participation by other 

agencies and groups that could sample other areas using the LTRMP sampling     

protocol.                                                                      



The LTRMP conducts highly standardized fish sampling in main channel border,   

tailwater, side channel, contiguous (to the main channel or side channels)     

backwater, and impounded aquatic areas in each study reach.  Sampling is       

conducted using electrofishing, hoop netting, fyke (trap) netting, seining,    

and trawling.                                                                  



Fish sampling is conducted from June 15 through July 31, August 1 through      

September 14, and September 15 through October 31.  Prior to 1993, each fixed  

site was sampled once (two "replicates" per site) during each time period.     

Beginning in 1993, independently distributed sampling sites have been sampled  

within a combination of stratum and time period.                               



Gears and use of gear are highly standardized within the LTRMP.  See the Fish  

Monitoring section of the LTRMP Procedures Manual (Gutreuter et al. 1995) for  

details.                                                                       



Data Composition                                                               



Principal fish data collected are species composition, relative abundance      

(catch-per-unit-effort) and length distribution of catches.  Subsamples from   

a few species (particularly freshwater drum) are collected for age             

determination, growth analysis, and examination of food use.  The LTRMP also   

collects considerable site-specific data on environmental conditions and       

quality assurance measures.  LTRMP data and their interpretation are described 

in Gutreuter et al. 1994.

trawl haul. Completion of this field is required only for electrofishing,
trawling, and trammel net drifting
EFFORT HOURS
Used to document actual elapsed time in hours required to capture a
sample of fish (actual duration of gear deployment).
This field should be blank for seine samples.
EFFORT MINUTES
Used to document actual elapsed time in minutes required to capture a
sample of fish (actual duration of gear deployment).

fork of caudal fin (tip of median fin rays)
S = Standard length; distance from anterior-most extreme of head (jaw
closed) to caudal peduncle (posterior margin of hypural bone)
GROUP WIDTH
Numeric field to record the range in centimeters of a
a length group from within which fish were enumerated or bulk-
weighed. For example, if LENGTH is 40 and GRP WIDTH is 1, then

FISH COUNT
Numeric field to record counts of fish represented by
the row of data. Fish Count is 1 for all individually measured
lengths and weights and ?1 for bulk counts. For example, if a
particular fish was measured to the nearest 1 millimeter, then Fish
Count is 1. If just one fish of a particular length group is
encountered during length group enumeration, then Fish Count is
also 1 for that length group. However, if 10 fish of a length
group are encountered during group enumeration, then Fish
Count is 10.
